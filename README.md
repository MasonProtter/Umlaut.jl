Umlaut.jl is a code tracer for the Julia programming language. It lets you trace the function execution, recording all primitive operations onto a linearized tape.


> :point_right: Umlaut.jl was started as a fork of Ghost.jl trying to overcome some of its
> limitations, but eventually the codebase has diverged so much that the new package was
> born. Although the two have pretty similar API, there are several notable differences.
